I need a task manager

I use MacOs apple chip

It has to have a floating button at the botton right and via some shortcut?


It should support creating list of items
no sync required for now
Basically kind of like google keep but with floating windows. each list will be its own floating window, which i should be able to arrange. 
Add some text editing features, very minimal.
I should be able to edit and install the application very fast

Add more features as you like
